        Compared with conventional agriculture, organic farming uses fewer
        pesticides, reduces soil erosion, decreases nitrate leaching into
        groundwater and surface water, and recycles animal wastes back into the
        farm. These benefits are counterbalanced by higher food costs for
        consumers and generally lower yields.
